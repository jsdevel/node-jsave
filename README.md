# jsave

Save and load JSON to and from disk.

`jsave` adds a non enumerable `save` method to objects and arrays.  Once you call
`jsave({})`, the object then has a `save` method.  This means you can treat your
data like you normally would, and when you're ready to save your changes to
disk, just call `save()`.  It's really that simple.

You can also load data from an existing file by calling `jsave.load(filePath);`.

Both `save` and `load` are unobtrusive.  The file path you provide will
be created in the event it doesn't exist.  Attempting to `save` or `load` to a directory
will throw an error.

Because `jsave` adds a save method to your data, only objects and Arrays are allowed.
Allowing primitives doesn't make much sense, but if you can find a way to make it so,
please issue a pull request!

##Example

###Saving data

Here you can see that jsave _does not_ change the way you interact with your data.
`jsave` adds a non enumerable `#save` method to objects and arrays.

````javascript
var jsave = require('jsave');
var file = '/tmp/some-file';//some-file doesn't exist yet
var myData = {};

jsave(myData).to(file);//now some-file exists and is empty

myData.sushi = 'rolled';
myData.save();//some-file now contains '{"sushi":"rolled"}';
````

###Loading a new file
Here we'll load a file that doesn't exist yet.  `jsave` will create the file for us
and return an object.  Once we `save` the object, future calls to this file will
load our data.

````javascript
var jsave = require('jsave');
var myData = jsave.load('/tmp/file-i-want');
if(!myData.burritos){
  myData.burritos = [];
  myData.burritos.push({name:'Beacon', type:'breakfast'});
}
myData.save();
// /tmp/file-i-want now contains:
//{"burritos":[{"name":"Beacon","type":"breakfast"}]}
````

###Loading an existing file

Here we'll load some existing JSON that's already on disk.

````javascript
var jsave = require('jsave');
var myData = jsave.load('/tmp/some-other-file');
myData.boo = 'ahhhh';
myData.save();//as you would expect, /tmp/some-other-file now has boo ahhhh :)
